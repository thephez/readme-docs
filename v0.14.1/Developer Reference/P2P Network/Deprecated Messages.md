The following network messages have been deprecated and should no longer be used.

# alert

![Warning icon](https://github.com/dash-docs/dash-docs/raw/master/img/icons/icon_warning.png) Deprecated since 0.14.1

*Added in protocol version 311.*
*Removed by Bitcoin in protocol version 70013, but retained by Dash until 0.14.1.*

The `alert` message warns nodes of problems that may affect them or the rest of the network. Each `alert` message is signed using a key controlled by respected community members, mostly Dash Core developers.

To ensure all nodes can validate and forward `alert` messages, encapsulation is used. Developers create an alert using the data structure appropriate for the versions of the software they want to notify; then they serialize that data and sign it. The serialized data and its signature make up the outer `alert` message---allowing nodes which don't understand the data structure to validate the signature and relay the alert to nodes which do understand it. The nodes which actually need the message can decode the serialized data to access the inner `alert` message.

The outer `alert` message has four fields:

| Bytes       | Name            | Data Type        | Description
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------
| *Variable*  | alert bytes     | compactSize uint | The number of bytes in following alert field.
| *Variable*  | alert           | uchar            | The serialized alert.  See below for a description of the current alert format.
| *Variable*  | signature bytes | compactSize uint | The number of bytes in the following signature field.
| *Variable*  | signature       | uchar            | A DER-encoded ECDSA (secp256k1) signature of the alert signed with the developer's alert key.

Although designed to be easily upgraded, the format of the inner serialized alert has not changed since the `alert` message was first introduced in protocol version 311.

| Bytes    | Name              | Data Type                 | Description
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------
| 4        | version           | int32_t                   | Alert format version.  Version 1 from protocol version 311 through at least protocol version 70002.
| 8        | relayUntil        | int64_t                   | The time beyond which nodes should stop relaying this alert.  Unix epoch time format.
| 8        | expiration        | int64_t                   | The time beyond which this alert is no longer in effect and should be ignored.  Unix epoch time format.
| 4        | ID                | int32_t                   | A unique ID number for this alert.
| 4        | cancel            | int32_t                   | All alerts with an ID number less than or equal to this number should be canceled: deleted and not accepted in the future.
| *Varies* | setCancel count   | compactSize uint          | The number of IDs in the following setCancel field.  May be zero.
| *Varies* | setCancel         | int32_t                   | Alert IDs which should be canceled.  Each alert ID is a separate int32_t number.
| 4        | minVer            | int32_t                   | This alert only applies to protocol versions greater than or equal to this version. Nodes running other protocol versions should still relay it.
| 4        | maxVer            | int32_t                   | This alert only applies to protocol versions less than or equal to this version. Nodes running other protocol versions should still relay it.
| *Varies* | user\_agent count | compactSize uint          | The number of user agent strings in the following setUser\_agent field.  May be zero.
| *Varies* | setUser\_agent    | compactSize uint + string | If this field is empty, it has no effect on the alert.  If there is at least one entry is this field, this alert only applies to programs with a user agent that exactly matches one of the strings in this field.  Each entry in this field is a compactSize uint followed by a string---the uint indicates how many bytes are in the following string.  This field was originally called setSubVer; since BIP14, it applies to user agent strings as defined in the `version` message.
| 4        | priority          | int32_t                   | Relative priority compared to other alerts.
| *Varies* | comment bytes     | compactSize uint          | The number of bytes in the following comment field.  May be zero.
| *Varies* | comment           | string                    | A comment on the alert that is not displayed.
| *Varies* | statusBar bytes   | compactSize uint          | The number of bytes in the following statusBar field.  May be zero.
| *Varies* | statusBar         | string                    | The alert message that is displayed to the user.
| *Varies* | reserved bytes    | compactSize uint          | The number of bytes in the following reserved field.  May be zero.
| *Varies* | reserved          | string                    | Reserved for future use.  Originally called RPC Error.

**Alert key compromise:** Dash Core's source code defines a particular set of alert parameters that can be used to notify users that the alert signing key has been compromised and that they should upgrade to get a new alert public key. Once a signed alert containing those parameters has been received, no other alerts can cancel or override it.

# ix

![Warning icon](https://github.com/dash-docs/dash-docs/raw/master/img/icons/icon_warning.png) Deprecated since 0.14.1

The `ix` message (transaction lock request) has the same structure as the `tx` message. The masternode network responds with `txlvote` messages if the transaction inputs can be locked.


# txlvote

![Warning icon](https://github.com/dash-docs/dash-docs/raw/master/img/icons/icon_warning.png) Deprecated since 0.14.1

The `txlvote` message ([transaction lock vote][msg_txlock_vote]) is sent by masternodes to indicate approval of a transaction lock request `ix` message.

| Bytes | Name | Data type | Required | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| 32 | txHash | uint256 | Required | TXID of the transaction to lock
| 36 | outPoint | outpoint | Required | The unspent outpoint to lock in this transaction
| 36 | outpointMasternode | outpoint | Required | The outpoint of the masternode which is signing the vote
| 32 | quorumModifierHash | uint256 | Required | *Added in protocol version 70213. Only present when Spork 15 is active.*<br><br>
| 32 | masternodeProTxHash | uint256 | Required | *Added in protocol version 70213. Only present when Spork 15 is active.*<br><br>The proTxHash of the DIP3 masternode which is signing the vote
| 96 | vchMasternodeSignature | char[] | Required | Masternode BLS signature
